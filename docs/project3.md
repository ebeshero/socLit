This digital project involves creating concept and network maps to help visualize patterns in August Wilson’s plays, *Gem of the Ocean* and *Radio Golf*. We will work with Google Sheets again, but in a new way, to organize information about related concepts and map it with [Kumu’s free visualization platform](https://kumu.io/). We will get started by [setting up accounts following Kumu’s documentation](https://docs.kumu.io/getting-started/first-steps.html), and we will be exploring how to structure and import data from a published Google Sheet following [Kumu’s documentation](https://docs.kumu.io/guides/import.html). The first challenge for us will be determining what kinds of patterns we are interested in visualizing. Each student records and visualizes pattern individually, choosing options, such as:

* social network: who is on stage together in the same scenes, and what locations connect characters?
* material objects and which characters are connected with them
* symbolic concepts and material objects in the plays
    * for example: diagram the journey to the City of Bones 
* Mythic shared identities, with the individuals who share those identities, perhaps with material objects they are associated with
* Historical events and people outside the text who relate to or connect with events in the play


### Phase 1: 
In class we will start with some planning exercises to set up the columns in Google Sheets and experiment with visualizations.

The Google Sheet will have two tabs, one for Elements and one for Connections. Elements provide basic information on each node you want to map, such as, for Aunt Ester, that she is a person seen on stage, that she is a spiritual leader, and (if you wish) has an image. The Connections sheet records connections Aunt Ester has with others. The visualization can indicate whether she made or received those connections (to give the association a *direction* from agent to recipient), or whether the connection is simply mutual or shared. 

Begin setting it up following my [starter template file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i-4uVGx8SCdELPQIkLW9d3PVmj8BcJcrvnPzxLsIPH4/edit?usp=sharing).

To help give you an idea of how you can build “maps” or networks with the date you are collecting, here are some sample files:
* [a sample Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W72Vx7JVN0GysZ1x0tHR5Z5ULHBYCvnqkZzjnF7i0I0/edit?usp=sharing) that I began with a set of data on people and objects on and offstage in the play.
* Here is a [network visualization made with the sheet above](https://kumu.io/ebeshero/dr-bs-august-wilson-experimental-network#augustwilsonstarter).

### Class directory of links:
Please record <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VUYv9wUKrObej-rgQOHUkAAnH2BKQYTIa54CSFA4rtU/edit?usp=sharing">links to your Google Sheets and visualization files here</a>. This page (below the directory) also contains detailed advice and codeblocks for customizing your network visualization in Kumu.

### Phase 2: Building networks from plays
Once you have worked out how to organize data into columns and customize displays of of your network, work on designing:

* *at least one* complete and thorough network of elements and connections to represent the complete play, *Gem of the Ocean*. 
* *at least one* complete and thorough network of a *related* network of elements and connections (re-using at least some of your types and tags) to represent the complete play, *Radio Golf*.    

Your networks should be developed from Elements with a coherently organized set of Types and Tags, and you should provide images and descriptions for at least the most important nodes. Elements can be anything you find significant: characters (on or offstage), objects on stage, events, locations, shared identities, etc. 

You do not have to plot out every kind of relationship imaginable, but choose to follow specific patterns and try to do so completely by finding *everything* of a kind. (If you are going to comment on character’s connected to stage objects, look at all the stage directions as well as dialogue and make sure you are capturing every object as it changes hands.) 

Choose the words you use for the Type and Tags columns with care to help you make an easily readable visualization. It’s best if the categorical words you apply for Types and Tags are reusable at least once. Run the Social Network Analysis function in Kumu to generate metrics to use in sizing your nodes and weighting your connections. 

### Phase 3: Analysis and Reflection: Essay
Study the networks you have made for these plays, and note patterns that look significant in the relationships you have graphed. What aspects of the plays stand out to you as you survey the networks you have charted? Does *Radio Golf* mostly resemble *Gem of the Ocean* in the kinds of relationships we see, or can we see some clear and interesting differences between the two plays in studying them? Use your graphs to direct you back to passages of interest in each play that help to highlight something important about the social network in each play. You might concentrate on patterns that highlight tension and conflict, and whether these are associated with particularly meaningful objects. Take your paper beyond the graphs you've created to help you discuss the contents of the plays. 

Write a heading to your paper on the top left corner of page 1, but not appearing on later pages, giving the following information:
