### Projects

Class assignments each involve working with digital tools to visualize patterns in our course readings. 

#### Digital Project 1: Map time and place in Octavia Butler’s *Parable of the Sower*
Set up Google Drive to create a directory for your work in this class. Work with [TimeMapper](http://timemapper.okfnlabs.org/): Save a TimeMapper Google Sheets template to your Google Drive folder. Develop the Google Sheets file following the template to describe events in Octavia Butler’s *Parable of the Sower* and record their timespans and locations. Visualize the timemap using TimeMapper's web form.
